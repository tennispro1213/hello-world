# hello-world
my first repository



I'm kinda confused by this site, but nevertheless, I like it.
Maybe I should try this when I don't have finals tomorrow....whatever.
So I'm supposed to talk about myself; I'm tall, or at least I used to be till everyone caught up. I like videogames, tennis (obviously), and physics (second to programming). I am an amateur, but that doesn't stop me from loving to code.
Unfortunately, I have not yet had tacos on the moon nor on Mars.

UPDATE:
This is now being worked upon from my Macintosh.
I'm learning how to use basic github commands. Eventually I plan to contribute to open source.
I hope I'm able to manage.
Oh, also, I'm going to try and copy this onto a flashdrive and put it on the raspberry pi to see if it's possible to work on it from there.
Wish me luck!

Now this is on my account on the Mac.
