# hello-world
my first repository



I'm kinda confused by this site, but nevertheless, I like it.
Maybe I should try this when I don't have finals tomorrow....whatever.
So I'm supposed to talk about myself; I'm tall, or at least I used to be till everyone caught up. I like videogames, tennis (obviously), and physics (second to programming). I am an amateur, but that doesn't stop me from loving to code.
Unfortunately, I have not yet had tacos on the moon nor on Mars.
